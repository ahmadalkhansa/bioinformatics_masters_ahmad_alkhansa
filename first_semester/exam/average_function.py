# average_function.py
# For this exercise the pseudo-code is required (in this same file) 
# Write a function that calculates the average of the values of
# any vector of 10 numbers 
# Each single value of the vector should be read from the keyboard
# and added to a list.
# Print the input vector and its average 
# Define separate functions for the input and for calculating the average

'''
pseudo-code:
'''
1. define a functione called averagefunction of arguments vector
